Salary Estimation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Project Overview
This project aims to estimate the salary of individuals based on certain features such as years of experience, education level, and job position. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to make predictions by analyzing the relationship between these features and salary.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project should include various features that may influence an individual's salary. Typical features might include:

Years of Experience
Education Level (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, PhD)
Job Position
Industry
Location
Previous Salary
Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model.

Features
The features used in this project for salary prediction are:

Years of Experience: Numeric value representing the number of years the individual has worked.
Education Level: Categorical value representing the highest level of education achieved.
Job Position: Categorical value representing the job title or role.
Industry: Categorical value representing the industry in which the individual works.
Location: Categorical value representing the location of the job.
These features are used as inputs to the KNN model to estimate the salary.

KNN Algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm. It works by finding the 'k' nearest data points in the feature space and predicting the target variable (salary in this case) based on the average salary of these neighbors.

Hyperparameters
k: The number of nearest neighbors to consider. Common values are 3, 5, 7, etc.
Distance Metric: The metric used to measure distance between data points (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
Model Training
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and normalize/standardize the features if necessary.
Splitting the Dataset: Split the data into training and test sets.
Training the Model: Use the KNN algorithm with the training data to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable (salary).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the value of 'k' and the distance metric using cross-validation.
Evaluation
After training the model, evaluate its performance using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
RÂ² Score
Evaluate the model on the test set to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Usage
Once the model is trained, it can be used to estimate salaries for new data points.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor

# Load the trained model
model = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5)

# Predict salary for a new individual
new_data = [[5, 'Master', 'Software Engineer', 'Tech', 'New York']]
predicted_salary = model.predict(new_data)

print(f'Estimated Salary: ${predicted_salary[0]:,.2f}')
